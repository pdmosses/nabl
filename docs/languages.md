# Languages in this repository

The repository [`metaborg/nabl`](https://github.com/metaborg/nabl/) includes several Spoofax language projects.
A separate hyperlinked twin website has been generated for each language project:[^1]

**[Statix]**
: supersedes the deprecated NaBL and NaBL2 meta-languages

**[NaBL2]**
: used for specifying the name binding of Statix

**[NaBL]**
: used for specifying the name binding of SDF3 (and of NaBL itself)

[^1]: The separation of the websites supports search-based navigation within each language project.

[Statix]: ../../statix.lang/
[NaBL2]:  ../../nabl2.lang/
[NaBL]:   ../../org.metaborg.meta.lang.nabl/
