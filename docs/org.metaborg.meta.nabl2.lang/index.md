# NaBL2

> The NaBL2 'Name Binding Language' supports the specification of name binding
and type checking rules of a language.

> NaBL2 uses a constraint-based approach, and uses scope graphs for name resolution.

The [NaBL2] documentation explains the details.

NaBL2 is now deprecated. It has been superseded by [Statix].

However, NaBL2 is still used in Spoofax 2 for specifying the name binding of several meta-languages
(e.g., [Statix]).

## Syntax

[`syntax/NaBL2Lang.sdf3`](syntax/NaBL2Lang.sdf3.md)

The syntax of NaBL2 is specified in [SDF3].

## Name binding

The name binding of NaBL2 definitions has not been specified,
so browsing them is not supported by hyperlinked twins.
