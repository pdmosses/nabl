# NaBL2

The NaBL2 'Name Binding Language' supports the specification of name binding and type checking rules of a language.

NaBL2 uses a constraint-based approach, and uses scope graphs for name resolution.

See the [NaBL2] documentation for further details.

NaBL2 is now deprecated. It has been superseded by [Statix].

However, NaBL2 is still used in Spoofax (v2.5.18) for specifying the name binding of several meta-languages
(e.g., [Statix]).
